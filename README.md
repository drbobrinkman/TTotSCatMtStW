# The Tale of the Stone Children that Live in the Earth, and of the Maiden that Soothed the World
This is my game (well, sort-of) for the 2017 Global Game Jam. Visit my [game page](http://globalgamejam.org/2017/games/tale-stone-children-live-earth-and-maiden-soothed-world) for more information.

## Building this project
In order to build this project you will need:

0. Visual Studio 2015 Update 3, plain vanilla install (not customized)
1. Unity3D version 5.5.0f3, with the Windows 10 Universal plugin (will prompt you to download if you don't have it)
2. HoloLens Toolkit version 1.5.5.0
3. Blender 2.78a

The first time you build the project you may need to update some project settings. When you build in Unity3D, it will create a Visual Studio project. When you open the project you will need to change from "Debug" to "Release" and from "ARM" to "x86" in the configuration drop downs. See Microsoft's [Holograms 101](https://developer.microsoft.com/EN-US/WINDOWS/HOLOGRAPHIC/holograms_101) for step-by-step instructions.
