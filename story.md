# The Tale of the Stone Children that Live in the Earth, and of the Maiden that Soothed the World

Long ago, when the world was new, there was a young maiden born of the earth. She stretched her arms up, to feel the wind. She stretched her feet down, to feel the soft grass. The sun on her shoulders warmed her.

But, as she was born of the earth, she could not help but hear the crying of the stone children, the children that live in the earth. With each cry the earth quaked. The trees shook, the animals scattered, and the cry of one child would wake another. The old stories tell us that in those days the earth shook continually throughout the day and the night, and surviving even one day to the next was a great trial.

For a time the maiden sat and pondered what to do. Then she took a tortoise shell that she found in the forest and, filling it with her tears, made a looking glass with which she could see the children in the earth. Next she cut a lock of her hair and hung the thickest hairs from a round stone to create a chime. Walking here and there, speaking comforting words, she played her chime to soothe the stone children.

And thus, from that day until this one, the earth's quakes are only few and short. By day and by night the maiden communes quietly with her mother the earth, watching over the earth's nursery, and soothing the troubled children back to sleep.
